    <h1 class="heading">Identity Values</h1>
    <h2>My Values</h2>

    <img src="Images/craftsmans.png" alt="my identity-values" class="identity">
    <p>
      Myers Briggs test identifies me as a craftsman (ISTP). Unsure if this test is actually who I
    am but, I guess it's a good indication :D</p>

    <h2>Describe your core personal values. </h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. 
        Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, 
        and the consequences of your action.

        <p>Everday there are instances where I make ethical decisions, whats important is what values
          I carry in those situations. 

          One of my biggest personal value is RESPECT. This very concept in my opnion, should be upheld 
          by everybody everyday. The ability to value and honor a person regardless if you 
          are accquainted with them or not. I believe the social structure is upheld by this value at 
          the forefront because without respect is despise. I don't have to agree with someones
          opnion but respecting their decisions has always benefited me.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.

        <p>
          I am a 2nd generation immigrant to New Zealand and being raised by a single mother who 
          survived the khmer reigme and was a refuggee for 10 years of her life, I was blessed 
          to be able to live in NZL my entire life with no 3rd world struggles. My mother is very
          hardworking, many people says shes a workaholic and doesn't understand 
          how to take a break. Her hardworking motor has influenced my values 
          and identity.
        </p>

      </li>
    </ol>

      <h2>Describe your strengths and limitations.</h2>
      <ol>
      <li>
        Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development </li>
        <p>One of my strengths that I consider different? Is that I'm competitive, regardless 
          if its mental or physical activity, I like to uphold myself to a higher standard 
          even if the obstacle at hand is obviously unattainble.
        </p>
        <li>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your 
          learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.</li>
          <p>
            Another trait I believe I posses is peserverance. 
            I don't quit easily, which is why I believe my decision to become 
            a web developer as a career fits my values very well. <br>
