      <h2>Analogy to describe Javascript and its relationship with HTML and CSS</h2>
    <p class="paragraph"> 
      Well first we must understand <b>What is HTML.</b> An HTML file is the structure of the page itself.
      <br>
      It is kind of like the structure of the building.

      <br>

      <b>What is CSS.</b>
      <br>
      A CSS file contains the styling of the page. It allows you to change colors, positioning and more.
      It is kind of like the design of the building itself.

      <br>

      <b>Finally what is Javascript.</b>
      <br>
      A JavaScript file determines the dynamic and interactive elements on the page. It determines what happens when users click,
      hover or type within certain elements.
      This is kind of like the functionality of the building.
    </p>

    <img src="Images/House.png" alt="House" class="house">
    <img src="Images/HtmlCSSJS.png" alt="HtmlCSSJS" class="HtmlCSSJS">
    

    <p class="control">
      Control flow is like the schedule of what people do on a day to day basis. Like a structured routine before you go to bed. 
      Some people have a cup of tea, maybe some netflix and hopefully brushing their teeth before they hit the hay. 
      Control flow are like the steps of your day to day routine and looping is basically the repeat of everything you've done. 
    </p>

    <h2>What is the DOM</h2>
    <p>
      The DOM is a tree-like representation of the web page that gets loaded into the browser. 
      It represents the web page using a‌‌ series of objects.
    </p>
    <img src="images/DOM.png" alt="DOM" class="">

    <p>
      By using the DOM we can access and change elements by specifiying an ID, class or element name.
      One way you can interact with the DOM is by using JavaScript is to change an HTML element. The following code selects the element class="test"<br>
<br>
document.getElementByclass('test') <br>
<br>
 You can grab the element with the class of 'test' and change its inner HTML text. <br>
<br>
document.getElementByclass('test').innterHTML = "new text"
    </p>

    <h2>What is the difference between arrays and objects</h2>

    <p>
      Objects represent a special data type that is 
      mutable and can be used to store a collection of data. (like bullet points) <br>  
      Arrays are a special type of variable that is also mutable and can also be used to store a list of values.(it uses numbers)
    </p>

    <h2>Why are Functions AWESOME!?</h2>
    <p>
      Functions is a block of code used for a particular task.
      Why do we love them? Because without them we would have to repeat code over and over again and nobody likes repeating themselves. <br>
      This following examples is what a very simple code of FUNCTION looks like. <br>
      <code>
      function sayHi () {
        <br>
        
      }
      </code>
    </p>
